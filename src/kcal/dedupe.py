"""Build a DayStats from raw Garmin responses.

Garmin's daily step total already includes steps taken during
step-based workouts (runs, walks, hikes). Any activity that reports a
`steps` count is treated as a workout, and its steps are subtracted
from the daily total so a step is never counted both as "background"
movement and as part of a workout.
